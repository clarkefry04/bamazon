This app has two different view points: bamazonCustomer.js and bamazonManager.js. 

The customer viewpoint will allow users to purchase any item within the existing inventory, at any quantity.

The manager viewpoint will allow the user to view current products, view items with low inventory, add inventory to any product, and also add new products.

Here is a link to a google drive folder that includes a short video example of how the customer and manager versions of the app function: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mFko00VtLfzBvPRC1ebD568y9IrV8sGc/view?usp=sharing
